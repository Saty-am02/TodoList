# TODO LIST
**A Vue Project**
<br>
A Vue.js Todo List project is a common and beginner-friendly application that involves creating a simple task management system. In this project, users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It's a practical way to learn the basics of Vue.js and understand how to manage state, handle user interactions, and manipulate the DOM.

Here's a brief description of the key features typically found in a Vue.js Todo List project:

- Task List Display:Users can view a list of tasks showing their titles and status (completed or not).

- Add Task:Users can add new tasks to the list. This involves a form where they input the task title and submit it to be added to the task list.
  
- Task Completion:Users can mark tasks as completed or toggle their completion status.
  
- Edit Task:Users can edit the titles of existing tasks. This is usually done through an edit button or by clicking on the task title.
  
- Delete Task:Users can remove tasks from the list. Typically, this is done through a delete button associated with each task.
  
- Local Storage:Some implementations include the use of local storage to persist tasks even when the user refreshes the page. This helps in maintaining the state of the application.
  
- Styling:While not a core functionality, styling is often included to make the application visually appealing and user-friendly.
